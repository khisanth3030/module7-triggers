Welcome to Module 6 of the Developer Kickstart curriculum at Cloud Code Academy! This module, we dive deep into the world of Apex Triggers - a fundamental aspect of Salesforce development.

## Goals of the Practice

During this module's practice repository, you will gain essential knowledge about:
- Understanding what Apex Triggers are and their role in Salesforce development.
- Recognizing when to use Triggers over other automation tools.
- Writing basic triggers to perform operations before and after insert, update, delete, and undelete events.
